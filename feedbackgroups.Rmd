Divide your feedback into two: major and minor comments, and enter them "chronologically". Remember that you are not evaluating the assignment - you're trying to help the authors improve it.

### Major comments

- Really good exploratory analysis
- Recoding the -1 values as NA could avoid some errors/trouble. E.g: 
    - The density plots of dist.to.Paamiut, dist.to.shore becomes very skewed.
    - The density plots of ODBA, VeDBA and strokerate becomes sligthly skewed.
    - The correlations plots and estimates gives counter-intuitive results - for example that Lat/Long should be so heavliy correlated
- Under "Analysis" it is difficiuly to follow your way of thinking. Some explainatory text would help.

### Minor comments

  
Aggregation of data set:
You could - as you point out yourselves - choose to aggregate data over the 30 minute intervals, instead of just taking one of the end-point observations. The risk of doing what you do is that skewed distributions may become even more skewed. For example, when you have only 0.41% of datapoints with Call=1, it is probably a coincidence that Call=1 is even represented in your new data set.

Skewed distributions:
It is correct that the distributions of e.g. Call is very skewed, but if you have time, it could be interesting to look at/comment on whether Call = 1 is represented more often at certain times (e.g. in Trial phases)

Dharma package:
As we don't know the Dharma-package and the plots it produces, it would be really nice if you could describe what the package does, how the plots  are created and how they are interpreted. For example, the Q-Q plots it generates are not standard Q-Q plots.

Autocorrelation plots:
The autocorrelation plots are a really good idea to determine the lag size! Overall, you do a very thorough analysis of correlation

Fitted models:
If you have time, it would be nice if you could write something about the other models you have fitted


- These are minor things, e.g. typos
- Enter then chronologically as well

And remember PEP!
