### Major comments

- Really good exploratory analysis
- Re-coding the -1 values as NA could avoid some errors/trouble. E.g: 
    - The density plots of dist.to.Paamiut, dist.to.shore becomes very skewed.
    - The density plots of ODBA, VeDBA and Strokerate becomes slightly skewed.
    - The correlations plots and estimates gives counter-intuitive results - for example that Lat/Long should be so heavily correlated, which does not correspond to what the swimming-pattern plot shows.
- Under "Analysis" it is difficult to follow your way of thinking. Some explanatory text would help.
-  The auto correlation plots are a really good idea to determine the lag size! Overall, you do a very thorough analysis of correlation.

### Minor comments
**Introduction**:
A small introduction, possibly including what questions you are interrested in answering, would be nice.  
  
**Aggregation of data set:**
You could - as you point out yourselves - choose to aggregate data over the 30 minute intervals, instead of just taking one of the end-point observations. The risk of doing what you do is that skewed distributions may become even more skewed. For example, when you have only 0.41% of data points with Call=1, it is probably a coincidence that Call=1 is even represented in your new data set.

**Time/Date:**
You could consider merging Date and Hour into a single Datetime (POSIXct format). You could also consider having the periodic pattern of Hour in your model instead of the linear effect of Hour. Then 00:00 and 23:59 would be the roughly the same instead of being opposites. 


**Skewed distributions:**
It is correct that the distributions of e.g. Call is very skewed, but if you have time, it could be interesting to look at/comment on whether Call = 1 is represented more often at certain times (e.g. in Trial phases).

**Dharma package:**
As we don't know the Dharma-package and the plots it produces, it would be really nice if you could describe what the package does, how the plots  are created and how they are interpreted. For example, the Q-Q plots it generates are not standard Q-Q plots.

**Fitted models:**
If you have time, it would be nice if you could write something about the other models you have fitted.
