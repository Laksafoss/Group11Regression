Divide your feedback into two: major and minor comments, and enter them "chronologically". Remember that you are not evaluating the assignment - you're trying to help the authors improve it.

### Major comments

- Really good exploratory analysis
- Recoding the -1 values as NA could avoid some errors/trouble. E.g: 
    - The density plots of dist.to.Paamiut, dist.to.shore becomes very skewed.
    - The density plots of ODBA, VeDBA and strokerate becomes sligthly skewed.
    - The correlations plots and estimates gives counter-intuitive results - for example that Lat/Long should be so heavliy correlated
- Under "Analysis" it is difficiuly to follow your way of thinking. Some explainatory text would help.

### Minor comments

- These are minor things, e.g. typos
- Enter then chronologically as well

And remember PEP!
