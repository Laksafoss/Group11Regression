Divide your feedback into two: major and minor comments, and enter them "chronologically". Remember that you are not evaluating the assignment - you're trying to help the authors improve it.

### Major comments
- You should reencode all -1 as NA before any analysis and plotting ! 
    - when plotting the densities of dist.to.Paamiut, dist.to.shore there is a large point mass in -1, 
      which would not have bben there, had you set -1 as NA
    - we would also remove -1 when plotting ODBA, VeDBA and strokerate. This is however a smaller error.
    - when leaving in -1 all correlations with a variable with NA becomes wrong. This is most clear with 
      the Lat/Long correlation since the correct values of Lat/Long are around 70/-26 and the NA's are set to -1,
      the interpreation of the correlation coefficient -0.98 is nore correctly interpreted as "Lat and Long are NA
      at the same times". If you calculate the correlation without the -1 you fint that it is 0.6 !

- Under header "Analysis" there is almost no text.


- These are substantial suggestions
- Enter them chronologically

### Minor comments

- These are minor things, e.g. typos
- Enter then chronologically as well

And remember PEP!
