Divide your feedback into two: major and minor comments, and enter them "chronologically". Remember that you are not evaluating the assignment - you're trying to help the authors improve it.

### Major comments

- These are substantial suggestions
- Enter them chronologically

### Minor comments

- These are minor things, e.g. typos
- Enter then chronologically as well

And remember PEP!
